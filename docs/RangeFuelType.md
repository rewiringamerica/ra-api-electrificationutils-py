# RangeFuelType

Fuel types inputs that the range upgrade API supports.  Note that we do not support electricity as the input because we are modeling upgrading to electric, and so upgrading from electric would produce no change.

## Enum

* `NATURAL_GAS` (value: `'natural_gas'`)

* `PROPANE` (value: `'propane'`)
